I am a PhD fellow at the Interdisciplinary Center for Economics Science (ICES) at George Mason University. My research interests include Applied Microeconomics, Financial Economics and Experimental Economics, with a particulor focus on combining the theoretical and experimental approaches to explore financial asset market mechanism design, especially within an imperfectly competitive environment.

I will be on the job market in AY 2025 - 2026.
